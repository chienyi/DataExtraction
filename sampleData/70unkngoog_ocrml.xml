        <line>The amount of this leakage will depend on the area of the hole or</line>

        <line>on the two sides. It is obvious that if air is lost before it reaches</line>

        <line>One of the most obvious conclusions from the inspection of several</line>
        <line>hundred stoppings is that the efficiency of a mine stopping to prevent</line>
        <line>the leakage of air depends more on the care with which the joints</line>
        <line>are made than on the material that is used in construction. Some</line>
        <line>concrete stoppings were found to leak large quantities of air because</line>
        <line>they were not set into the rib, and new tongue-and-grooVe stoppings</line>
        <line>were tight when carefully constructed. The amortised first cost is</line>
        <line>a small item when compared with the maintenance and efficiency</line>
        <line>charges, and the cost of cutting a latch in the rib is only a small</line>
        <line>part of the initial expense. The preparation of grooves in the ribs</line>
        <line>should therefore always precede the erection of stoppings.</line>

        <line>A general protest is being made against high velocities in the</line>

      </section>

    <region>
      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>1. The amount of power required to move a given volume of air</line>
        <line>increases directly as the cube of the velocity. If leaky stoppings</line>
        <line>make it necessary for the fan to deliver 4 times as much air as would</line>
        <line>be required if the stoppings were tight, the cost of the power to</line>

        <line>2. As the temperature and the relative humidity of the upcast at</line>

        <line>Structural steels, whose fields of use have already been noted, have</line>
        <line>some attributes in common, which makes it worth while to consider</line>
        <line>them collectively to a certain extent. These steels are working great</line>
        <line>improvements in the production of structures for various purposes,</line>
        <line>especially where the saving of weight or increase of strength or both</line>
        <line>are important, the most conspicuous example being undoubtedly the</line>
        <line>automobile industry. Heat-treated alloy steels with double or treble</line>
        <line>the strength of the simple steels they replace and with as great or</line>
        <line>greater reliabiUty are now in regular and most advantageous use. In</line>
        <line>common with other alloy steels, structural alloy steels owe a part of</line>
        <line>their superior properties to the presence of the alloying element but</line>
        <line>usually far more to heat treatment when it can be given to them.</line>
        <line>In automobiles the use of alloy steels is generally not advised unless</line>
        <line>the steels are heat treated, as the gain from their use in the natural</line>
        <line>or untreated state does not compensate for the increased cost.</line>

        <line>The difficulties attending the heat treatment of lai^e steel parts</line>
        <line>that are bulky for their weight are holding back their general intro-</line>
        <line>duction. They require, as nearly as is practicable, to be uniformly</line>
        <line>heated, imiformly cooled in quenching, and afterward, when cold, to</line>
        <line>be made true to form, as the quenching operation, however carefully</line>
        <line>done, usually leaves them warped or twisted. No doubt, in time,</line>
        <line>means will be foimd to overcome these drawbacks and such pieces</line>
        <line>as rails, and bridge members, of alloy steels will be used regularly in</line>

        <line>though very large, may be quenched without unmanageable warping</line>
        <line>because of its simple shape. The difficulty in making straight and</line>
        <line>true such an article as a heat-treated rail of pearlitic alloy steels lies</line>
        <line>largely in the springiness of the treated metal. It is not easy to give</line>

        <line>bend, or twist that may result from quenching. Yet this is necessary</line>

        <line>Many have asked when first considering the question, ' * Why not</line>
        <line>quench the casting when still hot with the initial casting heat?"</line>
        <line>The answer is that the heat of the various parts of the piece is not</line>
        <line>sufficiently uniform, the thicker parts being hotter than the thinner.</line>
        <line>If the piece is what might be called of uniform thickness, any comers</line>
        <line>or edges or parts first laid bare after casting are cooler than the rest</line>
        <line>of the piece, and even if the piece be a sphere, which is almost the</line>
        <line>only shape that will show a surface of uniform temperature after cast-</line>
        <line>ing, the interior wiH be so much hotter than the exterior, and wiU,</line>
        <line>therefore, when the sphere is inmiersed in a cooling bath, continue</line>
        <line>contracting so long after the surface is cold and contraction there</line>
        <line>has ceased that it will tear itself apart. The toughness of the metal</line>
        <line>will not prevent internal rupture under such conditions as there can</line>
        <line>be no contraction of area, as in the pulling test, to compensate for</line>
        <line>and so pennit stretching of the metal, which must therefore separate</line>
        <line>at its weaker spots and be subject to cracks.</line>

        <line>too great cost. The makers can save tungsten, copper, nickel, and</line>
        <line>cobsJt, each of which has an affinity for oxygen and a heat of com-</line>
        <line>bustion with oxygen less than the similar properties of iron; however,</line>
        <line>the makers can not at present save the manganese, silicon, vanadium,</line>
        <line>titaniimx, calcium, magnesium, and chromium, each of which has</line>
        <line>an affinity for oxygen and a heat of combustion greater than the</line>
        <line>similar properties of iron. Plans have been proposed for saving</line>
        <line>some of them. Saving a part of these oxidizable elements in rework-</line>
        <line>ing the scrap is in some instances of no benefit, because in replacing</line>
        <line>the wasted part by the addition of a fresh quantity of the ferro-alloy</line>
        <line>saturated with carbon there will be too much carbon in the finished</line>
        <line>steel. This is particularly true of manganese in manganese-steel</line>
        <line>scrap. The carbon in the aUoynsteel scrap is protected from oxidation</line>
        <line>hy the alloying element while the latter is being oxidized. With low-</line>
        <line>carbon alloy available the case is different, as the content of carbon</line>
        <line>in the steel may then be controlled.</line>

        <line>The objects of the Ohio ''run-of-mine" or antiscreen coal mine law</line>
        <line>of 1914 were to eliminate the objections to the *'run-of-mine" basis</line>
        <line>of payment to miners and to enact a system fair alike to employer and</line>
        <line>miner. The first section provides for the payment of the miners</line>
        <line>according to the total weight of coal in a mine car as removed from</line>
        <line>the mine, with the percentage of impurities to be determined by the</line>
        <line>industrial conmiission of the State; and operators, under the pro-</line>
        <line>visions of the second section, are not obliged to compensate miners for</line>
        <line>everything sent out in mine cars, but the percentage of impurities</line>
        <line>as determined by the industrial commission is to be excluded from</line>
        <line>the calculation; and while the industrial commission is authorized to</line>
        <line>determine the percentage of impurities and enforce its orders relating</line>
        <line>thereto, yet the ascertainment of the commission is not a limitation</line>
        <line>upon the right of the operators and miners to agree upon deductions of</line>
        <line>their own arrangements as to the amount of slate, sulphur, rock, or</line>
        <line>dirt, and they may substitute their own agreement in that respect</line>
        <line>instead of that of the commission. The law does not prevent the</line>
        <line>operators from screening their coal as they see fit for other purposes</line>
        <line>and fit it for market in such wise as they may deem advisable; but</line>
        <line>the provision for screening is for the purpose only of calculating the</line>
        <line>amount to be paid miners for mining coal. The statute does not</line>
        <line>make the orders of the industrial commission final or conclusive, but</line>
        <line>makes them only prima facie reasonable, and operators are entitled,</line>
        <line>upon petition, to a hearing upon the reasonableness of any order and</line>
        <line>are given the right to bring an action in the supreme court to test the</line>
        <line>reasonableness or vahdity of any such order. The statute is not un-</line>
        <line>constitutional as unduly abridging the freedom of contract in pre-</line>
        <line>scribing the particular method of compensation to be paid by operators</line>
        <line>to miners for the production of coal, under the constitution of Ohio,</line>

        <line>Section 4986, General Statutes of Kansas, 1909, requires all mines</line>
        <line>generating fire damp to be kept free from standing gas and that</line>
        <line>every working place shall be carefully examined every morning with</line>
        <line>a safety lamp by a competent person before any miner is allowed to</line>

        <line>naked light. The manifest object of these sections was to prohibit</line>

        <line>recognized fact that while mines containing '^horsebacks'' often</line>

        <line>tion of section 4380, Compiled Laws of Oklahoma (1909), was prose-</line>

        <line>the owner or operator of a mine to keep a sufficient supply of caps</line>
        <line>and timbers to be used as props convenient and ready for use, and</line>
        <line>requires them to be sent in and delivered to the places where needed</line>

        <line>the reasonable diligence of the miner; and for a court to hold that a</line>
        <line>failure of an operator to comply with this provision of the statute is</line>
        <line>too remote to be the proximate cause of an ultimate injury of a</line>

        <line>Under the statute of Iowa, section 2489-5a, 16a, Code Supplement</line>
        <line>of 1913, it is made the duty of a mine operator to furnish props and</line>

        <line>to prop his working place and make the same safe; but the fact that</line>

        <line>The statute of Missouri imposes upon a mine operator the duty</line>
        <line>of properly ventilating the mine, and a breach of such duty is negli-</line>
        <line>gence per se, and the operator can not delegate the performance of</line>
        <line>this duty to another and thereby shift responsibility or liability for</line>
        <line>its nonperformance; but the statute does not place upon the operator</line>
        <line>of a mine the duty of an insurer, but does impose upon him the posi-</line>
        <line>tive duty to exercise reasonable care to provide a sufficient amount</line>
        <line>of ventilation. The rule that the responsibility of the mine operator</line>
        <line>can not be shifted does not imply that the operator must perform the</line>
        <line>task of making a safe place or providing for the ventilation for the</line>
        <line>miner with his own hands, or that he is forbidden to require a miner</line>
        <line>to keep his own place in order, though the task be within the scope</line>
        <line>of the miner's skill and experience. It is not an attempted delega-</line>
        <line>tion of duty, but is in fact a step in the performance thereof when a</line>
        <line>mine operator, in the exercise of his legal right to direct a miner</line>
        <line>to do any and all things within the scope of the general employment,</line>
        <line>directs him to do that which, when done, will make safe the place</line>
        <line>of the miner's employment. The fact of directing a miner to dig</line>
        <line>coal from a partition wall, to make an opening therein for the pur-</line>
        <line>poses of ventilation, is not different from digging coal in any other</line>
        <line>part of a room, and the operator in ordering a miner to do such work</line>
        <line>for the purpose of securing proper ventilation, was not delegating a</line>
        <line>duty, but was requiring a service the operator had a right to demand</line>

        <line>The inflammability of coal dust^ that is^ the readiness with which</line>
        <line>a cloud of dust inflames, depends on the chemical and physical</line>
        <line>properties of the dust. For example, the finer the dust particles the</line>
        <line>more readily inflammable will be the cloud. The greater' the con-</line>
        <line>tent of inert material, as ash and moisture, the lower will be the</line>
        <line>inflammability. Tlie Tolatile matter of a given coal has an important</line>
        <line>bearing on its inflammability. Taffanel,^ in his gallery tests at</line>
        <line>Li6vin, France, found that the greater the content of volatile matter</line>
        <line>the more inflammable was the dust. From laboratory tests on a</line>
        <line>number of coals differing widely in volatile-matter content, the same</line>
        <line>author^ found that ^'the various coals tested, fineness and purity</line>

        <line>In 1912 the Bureau of Mines had its attention called ^o the value</line>
        <line>of the camotite ore of Colorado and Utah as a source of radium and</line>
        <line>to the need of investigations being made to prevent waste of low-</line>
        <line>grade camotite, to enable the miner to receive a better price for his</line>
        <line>product, and to insure the profitable recovery of the highest possible</line>
        <line>proportion of the radium ia the ore. The need of comprehensive</line>
        <line>research was iacreased by the camotite deposits being situated on pub-</line>
        <line>lic lands and constituting the largest known supplies of radiimi ore in</line>
        <line>the world. Fortimately the bureau was able to interest Dr. James</line>
        <line>Douglas, of New York City, and Dr. Howard A. Kelly, of Baltimore,</line>
        <line>Md., who wished to procure a supply of radium for use in the treatment</line>
        <line>of cancer in hospitals with which they were connected. The sug-</line>
        <line>gestion was made that they form a radium institute. Accordingly,</line>
        <line>the National Radium Institute was incorporated for the purpose of</line>
        <line>studying the best methods of producing uranium, vanadiimi, and</line>
        <line>radium, and the mining and concentration of ores from which these</line>
        <line>products may be obtained for use in radimn therapy.</line>

      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>Subsequently, at the suggestion of the institute, a cooperative</line>
        <line>agreement was made under which the Bureau of Mines undertook to</line>
        <line>provide the services of skilled chemists and mineral technologists for</line>
        <line>the supervision of the mining and concentrating of the camotite, and</line>
        <line>the National Radium Institute t^reed to furnish the necessary funds</line>
        <line>for mining and concentrating a sufficient supply of ore and for</line>
        <line>recovering from it the radium, uranium, and vanadium. Under this</line>
        <line>agreement a radium-recovery plant was built in Denver, Colo. The</line>
        <line>plant b^an commercial operation in June, 1914, and when it stopped</line>
        <line>work in January, 1917, about 8i grams of radium had been extracted.</line>
        <line>The cost of recovery under the methods devised by the Bureau of</line>
        <line>Mines was only about one-third the current price for radium. In</line>
        <line>addition, methods of saving the uraniiun and vanadiiun in the ores</line>
        <line>and of obtaining the metals in a pure state were perfected.</line>

        <line>that radium can be produced at a cost much less than the selling</line>

        <line>As the workable camotite deposits of Colorado and Utah, though</line>
        <line>lying near the surface, are relatively small, vary greatly in richness,</line>
        <line>and are extremely irregular in distribution, methods such as are</line>
        <line>ordinarily used for prospecting and mining shallow deposits have to</line>
        <line>be modified. Also, it is necessary to examine the ore carefully, sort</line>
        <line>it closely, a»d frequ3ntiy test its radium content with the electro-</line>
        <line>scope. Finally, the camotite deposits are mostly in an arid region,</line>
        <line>where water for any purpose is scarce, so that dry rather than wet</line>
        <line>methods of concentration must be used at most places. ^ Hence the</line>

        <line>above, and is included in the McElmo formation, which is of Jurassic</line>

        <line>times heavier charges of dynamite were used. Care had to be taken,</line>
        <line>however, to avoid mixing the waste with the ore or shattering the</line>

        <line>The disposal of waste had to be varied on each claim to meet local</line>
        <line>conditions. In many places, where the ore was in small pockets at or</line>
        <line>near the surface, the waste was shoveled to one side, after it had been</line>
        <line>ascertained that no ore lay beneath. In mining the larger deposits</line>
        <line>the usual practice was to shovel the waste back into the excavation</line>
        <line>as mining proceeded. On the Maggie C a deposit of low-grade</line>
        <line>milling ore, of considerable extent, lying 4 to 6 feet below the ship-</line>
        <line>ping ore, could not profitably be mined with the shipping ore but</line>
        <line>was of sufficient importance to reserve for later use in the mill.</line>
        <line>Therefore from this area the waste was transported to a dump at</line>
        <line>one side, under which the ore lay too deep to be mined by open out,</line>
        <line>by means of a f annahaped track system leading to the various work-</line>
        <line>ing places. The rock dump was gradually extended and built up</line>
        <line>level with the top of the ore bin of the mill, thus disposing of the</line>
        <line>waste and providing a grade for raising the milling ore into the bin</line>
        <line>when mined later.</line>

        <line>main tunnel and in one or two places in branch headings where the</line>
        <line>end of the track, owing to the pitch of the ore, could not be extended</line>

        <line>The wide variations in these figures are doubtless due to many</line>
        <line>causes, such as the personal equation of the sorter^ for although</line>
        <line>the sacks were of the same size some slight diversity in filling was</line>
        <line>possible. It was thought that the ore per sack would weigh heavier</line>
        <line>during the winter months, on the theory that the frozen ore con-</line>
        <line>tained more moisture. The difference in weight between a sack of</line>
        <line>ore containing 2 per cent moisture, as in summer, and one con-</line>
        <line>taining 7 per cent, as in winter, was not sufficient, however, from the</line>
        <line>record in this table, to increase the average appreciably during the</line>
        <line>winter months. The character of the ore on the different claims</line>
        <line>varied greatly. Some types of ore broke into fairly large pieces with</line>
        <line>very Utile fines, so that the' air spaces in the sack made it much</line>

        <line>changed noticeably at about the same time that new workings were</line>
        <line>being opened, so it is probable that changes in the character of the</line>
        <line>ore were the main factor in this diversity. On the Florence and the</line>
        <line>Great Western, where the ore usually ran fairly high in UaOg, and</line>

        <line>produce less dust, or heavier dust, than camotite ore. This fine dust,</line>
        <line>being rich in camotite, contains more uranium, radiimi, and vanadium</line>

        <line>this fine rich dust, some of which is as light as smoke, is lost, and a</line>

        <line>a bucket elevator, 5, and was then elevated to the upper floor in</line>
        <line>the building, where it was discharged into the feeder, 6, of a Newago</line>

        <line>end with a swinging discharge gate. The two cones were connected</line>
        <line>at their upper ends by a number of small gate shutters and had a</line>

        <line>Field tests of concentrates in the electroscope are in general the</line>
        <line>same as for ore, as described under 'Testing Ores." An important</line>
        <line>fact to be remembered is that the heat required to dry the ore for</line>
        <line>the Raymond mill drives off a certain amount of radium emanation</line>
        <line>from the ore, the amount varying with the degree and duration of</line>
        <line>heating. One-half of the emanation thus driven off will accumulate</line>
        <line>again in a period of 3.9 days, although approximately 30 dajrs are</line>
        <line>required for the emanation to regain full strength. The amount</line>
        <line>of emanation driven off in heating the ore in the mill of the National</line>
        <line>Radium Institute during the winter months was approximately 5</line>
        <line>per cent. Therefore, as this loss of emanation affected the apparent</line>
        <line>residt in the electroscope, if the radioactive strength of the fresh</line>
        <line>concentrates showed a uranium oxide content of 3 per cent, it was</line>

        <line>in its mill, and, as operations had to be discontinued on account of</line>
        <line>the expiration of contracts, the tailings were left on the dump.</line>
        <line>Tests made during this work, however, show that in a new plant it</line>

        <line>the tailings from the first. With one Raymond mill the mate-</line>
        <line>rial has to be rushed through in order to treat enough ore to</line>
        <line>make operation profitable. Under such conditions all of the car-</line>
        <line>notite can not be disintegrated, as the work of the beaters is</line>
        <line>largely to stir up the groimd ore so the dust can be removed, but</line>
        <line>by running the dust-free tailings through a second Raymond machine</line>

        <line>Early in 1912, from information received by the Bureau of Mines,</line>
        <line>it became evident that quantities of valuable radium-bearing ore</line>
        <line>from Colorado were being exported for manufacture in foreign coim-</line>
        <line>tries and that at least part of the manufactured product was being</line>
        <line>returned to this country and sold at a price entirely incommensurate</line>
        <line>with that received by the miner and the prospector. Consequently,</line>
        <line>in line with its efforts to increase efficiency in the mining and treat-</line>
        <line>ment of mineral resources, the Bureau of Mines undertook an inves-</line>
        <line>tigation of conditions. Results of this preliminary investigation were</line>
        <line>published, in the summer of 1913, as Bulletin 70,* which gave an out-</line>
        <line>line of the radiimi deposits of the West, the conditions of mining, the</line>
        <line>wastes involved, and the status of the production of radium from</line>
        <line>its ores.</line>

        <line>At about this time newspapers and medical journals were publish-</line>
        <line>ing statements regarding the value of radiimi in cancer therapy.</line>
        <line>These reports, although many of them were exaggerated, brought</line>
        <line>out clearly the remarkable virtue of the gamma rays for the treat-</line>
        <line>ment of cancer and other malignant growths. In view of the fact</line>
        <line>that the largest known supplies of radium ore in the world are in the</line>
        <line>States of Colorado and Utah and on the public lands of the United</line>
        <line>States, it was deemed highly important for the Bureau of Mines to</line>
        <line>study the production of radium in detail. Such study, it was hoped,</line>
        <line>would enable the prospector and miner to obtain a fairer price for</line>
        <line>the ores and would furnish information necessary in case Congress</line>
        <line>appropriated funds to develop methods for extracting radium</line>

        <line>At that time no appropriation for such work was available for this</line>
        <line>purpose. However, the bureau ascertained that Dr. Howard A.</line>
        <line>Kelly, of Baltimore, Md., and Dr. James Douglas, of New York City,</line>
        <line>were deeply interested in the production of radium for use in two</line>
        <line>hospitals with which they were closely connected. The suggestion</line>
        <line>was made them that they form a radium institute and endeavor to</line>
        <line>work up some 'of the American ores and keep the radium in this</line>
        <line>country for use among our own people. A member of the bureau</line>
        <line>went with Dr. Kelly to the Paradox Valley, Colo., and inspected the</line>
        <line>mines there, it having been agreed that if ore could be procured a</line>
        <line>radium institute would be founded and necessary funds furnished to</line>
        <line>work up the ore. As a result of this visit a conference was held</line>
        <line>with the officers of the Crucible Steel Co., who, through a subsidiary</line>
        <line>company, control 16 camotite claims in Montrose County, Colo.,</line>
        <line>which had been held pending the time when extraction of vanadium</line>

        <line>Immediately after the signing of the agreement and the organiza-</line>

        <line>May, 1914, began regular production of radium in June, 1914. The</line>
        <line>work was so successful that the directors of the National Radium</line>
        <line>Institute deemed it advisable to increase the capacity of the plant</line>
        <line>more than 100 per cent, and the construction of an addition was</line>
        <line>completed February 1, 1915. In addition, a grinding and sampling</line>

        <line>successful and continuous operation since February 1 of the present</line>

        <line>much larger quantity of radium must be used than is possessed by</line>
        <line>not more than two or three individual surgeons or hospitals in the</line>

        <line>has had the privilege of working with so much as half a gram of ra-</line>
        <line>dium that does not report cures in increasiog number or that is not</line>
        <line>able to treat even advanced cases with iacreasing assurance of sue*</line>

        <line>radium that can be applied at one time to the patient. Blacksmiths</line>

        <line>The market price of radium for some two or three years has been</line>
        <line>$120,000 and up per gram of element according to purity. At the</line>

        <line>liquids are heated without being evaporated, 12 lengths 6 feet long</line>
        <line>have been found sufficient. In the nitrate storage tanks, where a</line>
        <line>certain amotmt of evaporation is desired, the heating surface is nearly</line>
        <line>twice that for the larger ^anks. The steam flowing to these grids</line>
        <line>passes through a large baffle (20, Pis. V, VI, and VII) filled with vitri-</line>
        <line>fied brick, which eliminate impurities carried from the boiler. As the</line>
        <line>grids are also connected with suitable traps, a constant supply of</line>
        <line>distilled water is obtained and stored in a large iron tank (8, Pis. V,</line>
        <line>VT, and VII). From this tank distilled water is piped to the third</line>
        <line>landing to a point near the leaching pots, and by means of compressed</line>
        <line>air the water is elevated to this point whenever desired. As it is</line>
        <line>usually hot considerably less steam is needed in connection with</line>
        <line>leaching than if the water were cold. Exhaust steam is used for</line>
        <line>preliminary evaporation of the nitrate solutions.</line>

        <line>amber. The sealing-wax insidation is bridged across the bottom</line>

        <line>series of elements, radium A, B, and C, each of which deposits as a</line>
        <line>solid ''active layer" on the walls of the chamber, and contributes</line>
        <line>materially to the activity, it is necessary to wait three hoiu*s after the</line>
        <line>introduction of the emanation for the active deposit to have reached</line>
        <line>a maximum. This maximum is maintained with Uttle change be-</line>

        <line>It is also to be noted, however, that these active decomposition</line>
        <line>products of radium emanation carry a positive electrical charge when</line>
        <line>formed, and hence the position at wUch they are deposited in the</line>
        <line>chamber will be somewhat dependent on the electrical field to which</line>
        <line>they are exposed during deposition, and in turn the ionization and</line>
        <line>rate of discharge will be influenced. It would seem simple to allow</line>
        <line>the deposition of the active layer always to take place with no elec-</line>
        <line>trical field, but the difficulty here is that as soon as the field is made</line>
        <line>for measuring the rate of discharge, a shift in the position of newly</line>
        <line>formed RaA takes place so rapidly that even in the few minutes neces^</line>

        <line>either increasing or decreasing according to whether the new position</line>
        <line>of RaA is more or less favorable to ionization. To overcome this</line>
        <line>difficulty one practice is to keep the electroscope charged during the</line>

        <line>line, and it has been f oimd more satisfactory in the laboratory to</line>
        <line>charge for 15 minutes before the measurement. Thus any shift of</line>
        <line>RaA can be practically completed, and any shift of RaC (through</line>

        <line>from camotite more efficiently than will nitric acid, because the</line>
        <line>reducing action of hydrochloric acid prevents the vanadium from</line>
        <line>separating as vanadic add. In this respect even sulphuric add is</line>
        <line>better. The chief recommendation for using nitric acid is, therefore,</line>
        <line>the recovery of radium rather than vanadium. Indeed, it was found</line>
        <line>in the early operations that any attempt to extract the larger part of</line>
        <line>the vanadium almost invariably resulted in the precipitation of</line>
        <line>vanadic acid, retarding filtration and reducing the recovery of radium.</line>
        <line>Camotite itself is readily soluble in nitric acid, but the other vanadium</line>
        <line>minerals present, especially the siUcates, are decomposed only after</line>
        <line>long boiling. A considerable loss of vanadium, therefore, takes place</line>
        <line>at the start; owing to the insolubility of the vanadium minerals other</line>
        <line>than camotite. In order to prevent the separation of vanadic acid,</line>
        <line>the ore has been heated only as long as the solution remained green,</line>
        <line>heating being discontinued at once if the solution has showed any</line>
        <line>tendency to become brown. The main object, therefore, has been to</line>
        <line>recover radium even at the sacrifice of some of the vanadium. The</line>
        <line>vanadium content of the ore used has varied from 3.46 to 5.43 per</line>
        <line>cent V3O5, and ore carrying less than 5 per cent presents no difficul-</line>
        <line>ties in treatment; however, if this proportion is largely exceeded, the</line>
        <line>rapidity of filtration is affected, resulting in some loss of radium.</line>

        <line>Under the above conditions only about 45 per cent of the vanadium</line>
        <line>in the ore goes into solution. The iron-calcium precipitate involves</line>
        <line>a further loss. If sodium carbonate is run into a camotite acid leach,</line>
        <line>so that the Uquid is acid during most of the time, the vanadium losses</line>
        <line>will be large even though the carbonate is finally added in excess.</line>
        <line>Iron vanadates are seemingly formed near the neutral point and after</line>
        <line>precipitation are redissolved only slowly by the carbonate. In a</line>
        <line>small experimental plant that used this method to separate the iu*a-</line>
        <line>nium and vanadium from the iron and calcium the iron predpitate</line>
        <line>obtained carried 15 to 20 per cent VjOg. However, if the acid liquor</line>
        <line>is run into a boiling solution containing an excess of sodium carbonate,</line>
        <line>as already described, the iron-calcium precipitate obtained need not</line>
        <line>average more than 2 per cent V3O5, and the proportion may be re^</line>
        <line>duced even to 1 to 1.25 per cent under favorable conditions. As</line>
        <line>explained on page 55, the ruling factor is the length of time the solu-</line>
        <line>tion is boiled and how much excess carbonate is used. Of course, a</line>

      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>All the &amp;tct8 recorded indicate that the men were overcome by the insufficiency</line>
        <line>in the oxygen percentage of the air. There was no reason to suspect the presence of</line>
        <line>carbon monoxide as there was no gob fire or heating. In addition, the blood of the</line>
        <line>dead man was black, not red, as it would have been if death had been due to carbon</line>
        <line>monoxide. It is probable that sufficient fire damp was present to reduce the oxygen</line>
        <line>to 7 or 8 per cent. The fact that A did not recover was due to exactly the same cause</line>
        <line>which often prevents men recovering after severe carbon monoxide poisoning. The</line>
        <line>tissues have been severely damaged by the prolonged exposure to dearth of oxygen,</line>

        <line>The results of analysis of 111 samples of mine air from 29 coal</line>
        <line>mines are shown in the preceding table. The percentage of black</line>
        <line>damp in the samples varies from 0.14 to 82.92. The average per-</line>
        <line>centage of carbon dioxide in the black damp is 11.5 per cent, and</line>
        <line>the average percentage of nitrogen is 89.5 per cent.</line>

      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>The principal factors that probably affect the formation of black</line>
        <line>damp in coal mines are (1) time of contact between the air and coal;</line>
        <line>(2) rate of reaction of a particular coal with oxygen, with subsequent</line>
        <line>formation of some carbon dioxide; (3) temperature of the coal and</line>
        <line>the air, and (4) presence of moisture. Of these the two first are</line>
        <line>undoubtedly the most important; hence it is to be expected that</line>
        <line>different percentages of black damp will be found at different places</line>
        <line>in the same mine. In a return airway, where the velocity of the air</line>
        <line>current is high, and the air has been in contact with the coal only a</line>
        <line>short time, small percentages of black damp are found; however, in</line>
        <line>the same mine, at a working face, where the air travels slowly, or</line>
        <line>in an abandoned part of a mine, where the air is stagnant, the per-</line>
        <line>centages of black damp may be high, conditions clearly indicated</line>
        <line>by many of the results of analyses in the foregoing tables.</line>

      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>If all coals upon reaction with air produced carbon dioxide in the</line>
        <line>same ratio to the oyxgen consumed, then the percentage composition</line>
        <line>of black damp should be always the same in all mines. Laboratory</line>
        <line>experiments show, however, that there is no such constancy, as</line>
        <line>some coals produce more carbon dioxide in relation to the oxygen</line>
        <line>absorbed than do others; hence black damp formed by the action</line>
        <line>of air on different kinds of coal must vary in composition.</line>
      </section>
    </region>
    <region>
      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>A question of interest arises. Should the ratio between the carbon</line>
        <line>dioxide produced and the oxygen consumed be always the same for</line>
        <line>each coal? If one takes a sample of fresh coal and treats different</line>
        <line>portions of it with oxygen under the same conditions, practically iden-</line>
        <line>tical results will be obtained. If, however, one portion is allowed to</line>
        <line>weather a long time, or if more moisture is present in one than in</line>
        <line>another, the results are not so concordant. Probably, also, other</line>
        <line>factors must be taken into consideration. The analyses given in</line>
        <line>the preceding table show a fair degree of concordance; that is,</line>
        <line>samples of black damp from different parts of the same mine do not</line>
        <line>vary as regards percentage composition of the black damp nearly so</line>
        <line>much as do samples from different mines, although there is lack of</line>
        <line>strict concordance which shows that even in the same mine different</line>
        <line>samples differ in composition.</line>

        <line>dioxide was the predominating constituent. This is not the case.</line>
        <line>Nitrogen is much in excess. The bad effects produced are principally</line>
        <line>due to the fact that the rock gas so dilutes the air of the mines that</line>
        <line>the oxygen falls to a point where lights will not bum or so low that</line>
        <line>life is endangered.</line>

        <line>In the authors' opinion the acetylene light shoidd not be used as</line>
        <line>the sole warning against the presence of gas in these mines. It is</line>
        <line>true that where the acetylene lamp bums there is enough oxygen</line>
        <line>(12 to 13 per cent) in the air to support life, but under such conditions</line>
        <line>the air only a short distance beyond in a drift or at the floor may be</line>
        <line>fatal to life. The warning of a candle flame affords a much wider</line>

        <line>The effects of working in bad air of the Cripple Creek mines are</line>
        <line>typical of the effects produced by any low oxygen and high carbon</line>
        <line>dioxide atmospheres. After a day's work the men suffer a feeling of</line>
        <line>oppression, heaviness; and lassitude, or sleepiness, and a loss of</line>
        <line>appetite, the degree of distress depending, of course, upon the extent</line>
        <line>of vitiation of the air. When the air gets very bad, say when a</line>
        <line>candle will not bum, sUght exertion causes breathlessness. Much</line>
        <line>exposure in bad air brings on headaches and nausea and complete</line>
        <line>exhaustion. That more fatalities do not occur is due to the fact</line>
        <line>that the men fairly well appreciate the warning of their lamps and</line>
        <line>are careful about venturing where acetylene lamps will not bum.</line>
        <line>Collapse may be very sudden in atmospheres low in oxygen. In</line>
        <line>fact, it is typical of such atmospheres that httle warning is given of</line>
        <line>their great danger. In some cases men who have collapsed and</line>
        <line>been rescued have been days recovering. The after effects are very</line>
        <line>similar to those produced by poisoning by carbon monoxide.</line>

        <line>Dale** gives the depths to which certain foreign marbles will admit</line>

        <line>inches; Carrara statuary, 1.18 to 1.57 inches. The reputation of</line>
        <line>some marbles depends greatly upon this quality. As far as is known</line>
        <line>no figures have been obtained for the depth of light penetration into</line>
        <line>American marbles. Certain beds of Alabama marble are notably</line>
        <line>translucent. The same quality has been observed in marbles from</line>
        <line>Massachusetts, Vermont, and Colorado. Certain modes of artificial</line>
        <line>treatment are known to increase the translucence of marble. Usually</line>
        <line>the effects of such treatment are far less permanent than the material</line>

        <line>Authors generally agree that joints are caused by strains in the rock</line>

        <line>joints so caused would show no slickensided surfaces, and be irregu-</line>

        <line>theory that he rejected the term **joint" as failing to imply the ex-</line>
        <line>istence of relative motion, and introduced the terms "diaclase" and</line>
        <line>"paraclase." Joints are probably caused by pressure, and pressures</line>
        <line>in rocks may be highly complex. Curved joints indicate that the</line>

        <line>Crosby &lt;* claimed that earthquakes were important factors in the</line>
        <line>production of joints, each system being parallel with the earth waves</line>
        <line>producing it. Various systems must therefore have resulted from</line>
        <line>successive shocks. A second system will usually be nearly at right</line>
        <line>angles to the first, as an obUque shock would have foimd relief along</line>
        <line>the fractures of the first system. The presence of an oblique system</line>
        <line>presumes a shock of such high velocity that time was not allowed</line>
        <line>for the strain to find rehef along previous fractures. The same</line>
        <line>author in a later pubUcation * shows convincingly how shock and</line>
        <line>torsion may act in conjunction and produce results according with</line>
        <line>the phenomena as they occur in nature. His theory, in brief, is as</line>
        <line>follows:</line>
      </section>
    </region>
    <region>
      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>The torsional theory assumes a very slow, and the earthquake</line>
        <line>theory a rapid process of joint development. As fractures formed</line>
        <line>by slow processes are apt to be irregular, followii^ all places of</line>
        <line>weakness, torsional joints should be irregular. Most joint-s, how-</line>
        <line>ever, are fairly regular and are even known to pass directly through</line>
        <line>the hard pebbles of a coi^lomerate. Thus, a discrepancy appears</line>
        <line>in the torsional theory. A single system of regular joints may</line>
        <line>therefore be ascribed to shock. A subsequent shock in a transverse</line>
        <line>direction would tend to break up the sheets formed by the joints,</line>
        <line>the fractures being of a less continuous nature than those produced</line>
        <line>by the first shock, being terminated abruptly in many places by the</line>
        <line>first system of joints and continuing in a different though parallel</line>
        <line>plane. Thus two systems of an unhke character are best explained</line>
        <line>by the earthquake theory. However, two systems of like character</line>
        <line>may be referred to the torsional theory except when they exhibit the</line>
        <line>regularity indicative of instantaneous stresses.</line>

        <line>Crosby refers to the idea, upheld by many geologists, of an almost</line>

      <section id="0" label="SEC_BODY">
        <line>A method of prospect drilling that has been employed by at least</line>
        <line>one operator involves the use of the double core-barrel drill that was</line>
        <line>designed primarily for drilling bituminous coal, and operates in such</line>
        <line>a manner as to bring out a core from a delicate material with a</line>
        <line>miTiiTmiTTi of breaking or other damage. The drill, shown in Plate II,</line>
        <line>consists of an outer and an inner tube. The outer is attached to the</line>
        <line>drill rod by means of the core-barrel plug, and is rotated the same</line>
        <line>as the cutting tools. The inner tube is suspended by a ball-bearing</line>
        <line>plug at the top and centered by a ball bearing near the bottom.</line>
        <line>Thus, while th e outer tube revolves, the inner tube which carries the core</line>
        <line>ring or lifter at its lower end remains stationary. The core passes up</line>
        <line>through the bit into the inner barrel, where it is protected from fric-</line>
        <line>tion from the rotating parts, and from the washing action of the</line>
        <line>water. An ample water supply is provided between the two tubes.</line>
        <line>The purpose of the inner tube is to hold the core as immovable as</line>
        <line>possible, and thus to prevent the wearing or rubbing of the broken</line>
        <line>ends. Although the core does not revolve after it passes through</line>
        <line>the core lifter into the inner tube, the principle of cutting and the</line>
        <line>action of the bit on the core until after it passes into the inner tube</line>
        <line>are just the same as with the single-barrel drill. Therefore, if a natural</line>
        <line>parting is encountered in the rock, or if for any reason the core is</line>
        <line>broken off, it is liable to be rotated somewhat before it gets into the</line>
        <line>inner tube. If the core breaks obliquely the danger of rotation is</line>
        <line>minimized. Cores should be at least 2^ inches in diameter.</line>

        <line>It is practically impossible to take out good cores that are repre-</line>

        <line>a horizontal hole invariably breaks into short pieces, which grind</line>
        <line>on each other, in spite of the use of the double-core barrel. The</line>

        <line>also to prevent binding of the drill in the hole. As a result the</line>
        <line>progress of the drill brings a considerable weight on the unbroken</line>
        <line>end of the core, and as soon as the core is a few inches long it breaks</line>
        <line>off. The break occurrs seemingly at the bottom of the hole, the</line>
        <line>result being that the spring clips on the inner core barrel, which</line>
        <line>are supposed to hold ^e unbroken end of the core and thereby</line>
